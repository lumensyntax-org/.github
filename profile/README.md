# LumenSyntax

**Governance infrastructure for AI systems.**

We build tools that bring accountability and verifiability to AI outputs. Our core belief: AI systems should be able to prove what they know, not just claim it.

## TruthGit

Our flagship project. Version control for verified truth.

TruthGit lets you verify claims using multi-validator AI consensus, generate cryptographic proofs, and build governance layers for autonomous systems.

## Philosophy

Three laws guide our work:

1. **Law of Roots** — No truth without traceable source
2. **Law of the Gap** — Explicit uncertainty, never hallucination
3. **Law of Dignity** — Expose manipulation by fallacies
